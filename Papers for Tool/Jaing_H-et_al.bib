abstract = {In this paper, when Reynolds number is within the range of 10000 to 1000000, the horizontal component of the total pressure of flow around flat plate at high angle of attack was regarded as lift of high angle of attack, and the vertical component was regarded as drag of high angle of attack. The horizontal component of total pressure at small angle of attack was regarded as shape drag, and the total drag coefficient at small angle of attack was considered to the sum of the shape drag and frictional drag at zero angle of attack. For the two states of large and small angle of attack, the application scopes of the formulas of lift and drag coefficients were given. Final, the relations of lift and drag coefficients were obtained by eliminating all angles of attack. Research results show that lift - drag curve of small angles of attack is parabola, and the lift - drag curve of high angles of attack is circle.}
